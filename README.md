# Introduction
A portfolio project that provides basic data center infrastructure management. GridLock is a platform that supports IT asset lifecycle management and data center modeling tools.

## Planned Features
- Advanced Asset searching
- Asset management via forms
- Charting
- Grid Visualizations
- Rack sketches w/ Visio Stencils
- Network Fabric Algorithms
- Reporting Tools (Excel, XML, PDF)

## Platform
GridLock consists of 2 separate systems. This is the back-end, built upon a Spring MVC 5. [GridLock-Front-End](https://github.com/ryan-beckett/GridLock-Front-End) is the AngularJS 5 front-end.

## Design Challenges
This project took me roughly 1 month to build and get a basic dashboard up and running. I built the entire back-end from scratch, and modified a pre-built, premium AngularJS theme.
